# Exercise 2.9

# Implement a simple reflex agent for the vacuum environment in Exercise 2.8.
# Run the environment with this agent for all possible initial dirt configurations and agent locations.
# Record the performance score for each configuration and the overall average score.
# Output the sequence of actions for the environment and initial locations described in Figure 2.2

# 1X2 vacuum cleaner space according to Figure 2.2
# Initial dirt configurations and vacuum cleaner locations are:
# [(A, Clean), (B, Clean)], initial vacuum cleaner location = A
# [(A, Clean), (B, Dirty)], initial vacuum cleaner location = A
# [(A, Dirty), (B, Clean)], initial vacuum cleaner location = A
# [(A, Dirty), (B, Dirty)], initial vacuum cleaner location = A
# [(A, Clean), (B, Clean)], initial vacuum cleaner location = B
# [(A, Clean), (B, Dirty)], initial vacuum cleaner location = B
# [(A, Dirty), (B, Clean)], initial vacuum cleaner location = B
# [(A, Dirty), (B, Dirty)], initial vacuum cleaner location = B

# Task Environment and Key Assumptions:

# Task Environment:

# Environment class is the external environment
# with the WorldPosition class used to help construct that environment.

# Performance measure/score calculated in the
# SimpleReflexVacuumAgent's update_performance_score function.
# The performance score is an integer that is incremented each time the agent performs the sucking action
# on a dirty square. The reasoning for calculating the performance score in this manner goes as follows; the
# the primary intention of the SimpleReflexVacuumAgent (and a vacuum cleaner in general) is arguably to
# clean dirty squares through sucking in all the dirt. Therefore, the performance measure should evaluate
# the agent's ability to carry out this primary intention. The agent is programmed such that it will clean dirty squares
# through the sucking action as frequently as possible; that is, the agent will perform the sucking action
# for every dirty square that it perceives. Thus, for each action that the agent executes,
# it is expected that the performance measure (how many times the agent
# successfully carries out its primary intention of cleaning dirty squares) will be maximized given the
# initial environment configuration and agent location.

# Sensors feed information to the SimpleReflexVacuumAgent's specify_agent_action function.

# Actuator for cleaning dirty squares and moving between locations
# in the environment is defined in the SimpleReflexVacuumAgent's execute_action function.

# The SimpleReflexVacuumAgent has a run_agent_actions function that triggers a loop of actions that the agent executes.

# SimpleReflexVacuumAgent has a clean_square_counter variable that keeps track of
# how many squares the agent has visited and confirmed a status of clean.
# The clean_square_counter variable is part of a condition
# in the run_agent_actions function used to regulate the loop of executed actions.

# Key Assumptions:

# After the vacuum cleaning agent has sucked dirt from a square (and that square then becomes clean), the square
# CANNOT become dirty again.
# If a square begins with a status of clean, it cannot become dirty
# following the instantiation of the initial configuration.
# The Vacuum Cleaning Agent only finishes executing actions in its run_agent_actions function when the agent
# has checked upon visiting that both squares A and B have a status of clean.
# That is, the loop of executed actions in the run_agent_actions function
# only finishes when the clean_square_counter is equal to 2.
