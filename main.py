# Exercise 2.9

# Implement a simple reflex agent for the vacuum environment in Exercise 2.8.
# Run the environment with this agent for all possible initial dirt configurations and agent locations.
# Record the performance score for each configuration and the overall average score.
# Output the sequence of actions for the environment and initial locations described in Figure 2.2

# 1X2 vacuum cleaner space according to Figure 2.2
# Initial dirt configurations and vacuum cleaner locations are:
# [(A, Clean), (B, Clean)], initial vacuum cleaner location = A
# [(A, Clean), (B, Dirty)], initial vacuum cleaner location = A
# [(A, Dirty), (B, Clean)], initial vacuum cleaner location = A
# [(A, Dirty), (B, Dirty)], initial vacuum cleaner location = A
# [(A, Clean), (B, Clean)], initial vacuum cleaner location = B
# [(A, Clean), (B, Dirty)], initial vacuum cleaner location = B
# [(A, Dirty), (B, Clean)], initial vacuum cleaner location = B
# [(A, Dirty), (B, Dirty)], initial vacuum cleaner location = B

# Task Environment: Environment class is the external environment
# with the WorldPosition class used to help construct the environment.
# Performance measure/score calculated in the
# SimpleReflexVacuumAgent's update_performance_score function increases by 1 each time the agent cleans a dirty square.
# Sensors feed information to the SimpleReflexVacuumAgent's specify_agent_action function. Actuator for cleaning
# dirty squares and moving between locations in the environment is defined in the SimpleReflexVacuumAgent's
# execute_action function.
# The SimpleReflexVacuumAgent has a run_agent_actions function that puts the agent into action
# and only finished when both locations A and B have a status of Clean.
