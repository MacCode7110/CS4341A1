Exercise 2.3

For each of the following assertions, say whether it is true or false and support your
answer with examples or counterexamples where appropriate.

a. An agent that senses only partial information about the state cannot be perfectly rational.

    False
    If an agent senses only partial information about the state, it can still be perfectly rational.
    Rational agents can operate in a partially observable environment as their percept sequence is based on the content that their sensors percieve.
    In addition, rational agents should be autonomous, which means that they have the capacity to learn and build off of their prior knowledge of the environment and its state regardless of the extent of that knowledge.
    For example, a table-cleaning agent could be perfectly rational in a partially observable environment, and as part of that, be able to learn how to anticipate when and where new germs and bacteria will surface. 
    In the above example, the table-cleaning agent is rational if it selects actions that maximize its performance measure according to the information for each possible percept sequence (dependent on the content that the sensors percieve) and the amount of prior knowledge of the environment. In particular, as long as the agent is selecting actions that maximize its performance measure based on each possible percept sequence, it is rational regardless of whether the sensors provide access to the complete state of the environment at each point in time. 

b. There exist task environments in which no pure reflex agent can behave rationally.

c. There exists a task environment in which every agent is rational.

d. The input to an agent program is the same as the input to the agent function.

e. Every agent function is implementable by some program/machine combination.

f. Suppose an agent selects its action uniformly at random from the set of possible actions.
There exists a deterministic task environment in which this agent is rational.

g. It is possible for a given agent to be perfectly rational in two distinct task environments.

h. Every agent is rational in an unobservable environment.

i. A perfectly rational poker-playing agent never loses.
